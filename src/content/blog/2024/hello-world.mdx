wooo, I have a blog now, in fact ur _probably_ reading this post on it

Like with most things its often fun and informative to explore how we got here,
so to begin I will talk a bit about blog **lore**. This is not my first attempt
at building a blog but it is the first "proper" one I've built and shipped.

<SideNote type="note">
	I did have an old [blogspot/blogger](https://www.blogger.com) as a kid, which
	im not really counting, but its funny to think about
</SideNote>

I decided I wanted to make a blog after reading a number of independednt blogs
and finding them to be consistently inspiring, it got me thinking about projects
I have worked on or build and I felt a bit sad that there was no way to see some
of my oldest code and projects as they are not logged anywhere, this tends to be
at odds with my normal desire to document things and share any and all accrued
knowledge.

Over the past few years I have attempted to make a number of personal websites
but kept getting distracted or busy. This time I decided to try my best to
deliver _something_ I should try and keep things as simple while keeping a solid
base that I can easily extend and find non-limiting.

In my head I had a list of things that would be ideal for my blog, these being:

- Making a blog post should be as easy as making a markdown file
- I do not want blog posts to be limited by markdown as a format
- I want to use JSX for webpage templating as I personally prefer it to raw HTML
  with nunjucks, handlebars etc..
- I want to serve mostly static HTML maybe with the occasional bit of JavaScript
  injected for fun interactive elements like
  <Enticing>
  	<Meowable client:load>üêàthisüêà</Meowable>
  </Enticing>
  , as (imo) it makes for a nice user experience.

# Experiments üë©‚Äçüî¨

Taking my list of desires I wanted to figure out what was feasible, going in I
foresaw at least 2 possible approaches, use a SSG or build my own wierd custom
gluing bits together application, which although appealing would be me yak
shaving possibly leading to me once again not shipping anything and putting my
website back on the project shelf.

Something I had known about and wanted to use for a while was a format called
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for me it seemed perfect for writing blog posts as my
posts would not be limited by Markdown as I can stick components into the post
like <Grower client:load>this one</Grower> (go on click it, I know you want to).

Knowing I would prefer to use an SSG all I needed to do was find one that worked
like I wanted, I had heard good things about [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), so I
tried it out but quickly found it a little limiting for my desired use cases, as
I wanted to use JSX for templating I started making an 11ty plugin which for
this behaviour but felt like I was fighting 11ty to get what I wanted, so I
started looking for other options before I went further with rolling my own
plugins (since I carried out this investigation 11ty has gained support for
[MDX](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/mdx/) &
[JSX](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/jsx/)). When looking at different
SSG's I came across a framework called [Astro](https://astro.build/) which from
the sales pitch seemed suspiciously perfect, so I built a little hello-world
project and to my surprise everything I wanted was supported with minimal work
(mostly just adding 1st party dependencies), I could create blog posts in MDX,
create templates in JSX AND generate a fully static site with components that
could be loaded at runtime using the "islands architecture".

<SideNote type="note">
	I am a big fan of the islands architecture as it makes progressive enhancement
	using sprinkles of JS really easy <br /> (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ*:ÔΩ•Ôæü‚úß

# Implementing üë©‚Äçüíª

Building upon my initial PoC work with Astro I built up a project structure I
was happy with, and started building out my webpages, in the end I went with a
mix of Astro & Solid components which worked well for me.

# Deploying üöÄ

Before this project I had never deployed to AWS using terraform, it was fun and
interesting learning about both of them!!

As a Terraform/OpenTofu/HCL non-toucher, I initially found it difficult to parse
Terraform but after using it for 1 WHOLE project I have come to the conclusion
that it is fine‚Ñ¢. I feel no strong feelings towards it currently, I think there
are ways it could be improved and also things it does nicely.

That being said I was pleaased to see OpenTofu picking up the slack, and
implementing features that are missing in Terraform like using variables in a
[backend block](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/388)

My cloud stack for this site is fairly simple, it's hosted on AWS and uses the
following:

- CloudFront
- S3
- AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
- Route53

Essentially my website is an S3 bucket of static HTML files which are
distributed worldwide through CloudFront as a CDN. ACM is used for providing
HTTPS certificates and Route53 for DNS record management.

<SideNote type="quest">
	I initially tried using Cloudflare R2 and their CDN to save money but their
	terraform provider is lacking surprisingly basic (imo) features. You can only
	link an R2 bucket to your custom domain through the web console or by using
	some custom terraform to HTTP call their private undocumented API. [Please
	don't mark issues as completed unless they actually
	are.](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/2537)
</SideNote>

## A little problem

This works great, except for 1 teeny tiny thing, all my HTML files have a
`.html` at the end so would only be accessible through urls like
`/blog/index.html`, although this is not really a problem and event used by some
big retailers, I would prefer if links like `/blog` could be used. To fix this I
utilise a CloudFront function, this is a small bit of code that runs on each
request (for a fee üò≠).

<SideNote type="note">
	My CloudFront function also reroutes any requests on the `www` subdomain, to
	the apex domain.
</SideNote>

# Next? ü§î

Hopefully more blog posts about things I work on and improving parts of the blog
like my GitHub actions which only carry out the building and deploy of the site
but not CloudFront cache invalidation or applying terraform files (currently
done locally by me üò≥, which I am unhappy with)

I would also like to explore moving away from AWS for a less all encompassing
cloud provider maybe [bunny.net](https://bunny.net)?

# Conclusion ü•≥

Anyway that's how we got here, I would love to hear ur thoughts on my blog setup
or any ways I could improve it or if u have literally ANY OTHER THOUGHTS!!!!

This post took significantly longer than expected because I got worried about my
blog posts quality, so started working on other projects then I broke my elbow
and found typing hard but after being inspired by TodePond to
[normalise sharing scrappy fiddles sharing scrappy fiddles](https://www.todepond.com/sky/sharing-scrappy-fiddles-is-hard/)
I think that maybe my blog should allow me to riff and be a living space rather
than something to be protected & held in perfect condition.
