wooo, I have a blog now, in fact ur _probably_ reading this post on it

Like with most things its often fun and informative to explore how we got here,
so to begin I will talk a bit about blog **lore**. This is not my first attempt
at building a blog but it is the first "proper" one I've built and shipped.

<SideNote type="note">
	I did have an old [blogspot/blogger](https://www.blogger.com) as a kid, which
	im not really counting, but its funny to think about
</SideNote>

After reading a number of independent blogs, I felt inspired to build my own!
Despite having worked on many a project over the years, I did not have a real
place to share them, this leaves some of my oldest code and systems completely
lost to time. I feel regret about this due to my innate desire to document and
share any and all accrued knowledge.

This time I decided to try my best to deliver _something_. I wanted to try and
keep things as simple as possible while having a solid non-limiting foundation
that can be easily extended.

In my head I had a list of things that would be ideal for my blog, these being:

- Making a blog post should be as easy as making a markdown file
- I do not want blog posts to be limited by markdown as a format
- I want to use JSX for webpage templating as I personally prefer it to raw HTML
  with nunjucks, handlebars etc..
- I want to serve mostly static HTML maybe with the occasional bit of JavaScript
  injected for fun interactive elements like
  <Enticing>
  	<Meowable client:load>üêàthisüêà</Meowable>
  </Enticing>
  (u can click it :3), as (imo) it makes for a nice user experience.

# Experiments üë©‚Äçüî¨

Taking my list of desires I wanted to figure out what was feasible. Going in I
foresaw at least 2 possible approaches: Use a Static Site Generator (SSG) or
build my own wierd custom application, which although appealing would be me yak
shaving, possibly leading to me once again not shipping anything and putting my
website back on the project shelf.

Something I had known about and wanted to use for a while was a format called
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). To me it seemed perfect for writing blog posts as I
can easily enrich my markdown files by sticking components into them like this
one: <Grower client:load>CLICK ME!!!</Grower>.

Knowing I would prefer to use an off-the-shelf SSG all I needed to do was find
one that fulfilled my needs. I had heard good things about
[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), so tried it out but quickly found it a little
limiting for my desired use cases, as it did not support JSX for templating. I
started making an 11ty plugin for this behaviour but it felt like I was fighting
11ty to get what I wanted, so I started looking for other options before I went
further with rolling my own plugins (since I carried out this investigation 11ty
has gained support for [MDX](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/mdx/) &
[JSX](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/jsx/)).

When looking at different SSGs I came across a framework called
[Astro](https://astro.build/) which from the sales pitch seemed suspiciously
perfect, so I built a little hello world project and to my surprise everything I
wanted was supported with minimal work!! Using exclusively first party
dependencies, I could create blog posts in MDX, create templates in JSX AND
generate a fully static site with components that could be loaded at runtime
using the "islands architecture".

<SideNote type="note">
	I am a big fan of the islands architecture as it makes progressive enhancement
	using sprinkles of JS really easy <br /> (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ*:ÔΩ•Ôæü‚úß

# Implementing üë©‚Äçüíª

Building upon my initial PoC work with Astro I built up a project structure I
was happy with, and started building out my webpages. In the end I went with a
mix of Astro & Solid components which worked well for me.

# Deploying üöÄ

Before this project I had never deployed to AWS using Terraform. It was fun and
interesting learning about both of them!!

As a Terraform/OpenTofu/HCL non-toucher, I initially found it difficult to parse
Terraform but after using it for 1 WHOLE project I have come to the conclusion
that it is fine‚Ñ¢. I feel no strong feelings towards it currently, I think there
are ways it could be improved and also things it does nicely.

That being said I was pleased to see OpenTofu picking up the slack, and
implementing features that are missing in Terraform like using variables in a
[backend block](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/388).

My cloud stack for this site is fairly simple, it's hosted on AWS and uses the
following services:

- CloudFront
- S3
- AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
- Route53

Essentially my website is an S3 bucket of static HTML files which are
distributed worldwide through CloudFront as a CDN. ACM is used for providing
HTTPS certificates and Route53 for DNS record management.

<SideNote type="quest">
	I initially tried using Cloudflare R2 and their CDN to save money but their
	terraform provider is lacking surprisingly basic (imo) features. You can only
	link an R2 bucket to your custom domain through the web console or by using
	some custom terraform to HTTP call their private undocumented API. [Please
	don't mark issues as completed unless they actually
	are.](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/2537)
</SideNote>

## A little problem

This works great, except for 1 teeny tiny thing, all my HTML files have a
`.html` at the end so would only be accessible through urls like
`/blog/index.html`. Although this is not really a problem and even used by some
big retailers, I would prefer if links like `/blog` could be used. To fix this I
utilise a CloudFront function, this is a small bit of code that runs on each
request (for a fee üò≠).

<SideNote type="note">
	My CloudFront function also reroutes any requests on the `www` subdomain, to
	the apex domain.
</SideNote>

# Next? ü§î

Hopefully more blog posts about things I work on and improving parts of the blog
like my GitHub actions; currently these only carry out the building and
deployment of the site but not CloudFront cache invalidation or applying
Terraform files (currently done locally by me üò≥, which I am unhappy with).

I would also like to explore moving away from AWS for a less world owning
all-encompassing cloud provider maybe [bunny.net](https://bunny.net)?

# Conclusion ü•≥

Anyway that's how we got here, I would love to hear ur thoughts on my blog setup
or any ways I could improve it or if u have literally ANY OTHER THOUGHTS!!!!

This post took significantly longer than expected because I got worried about my
blogposts quality, so started working on other projects, then I broke my elbow
:c which made typing hard but gave me time to reflect and be inspired by
[TodePonds](https://mas.to/@TodePond) mantra to
"[normalise sharing scrappy fiddles sharing scrappy fiddles](https://www.todepond.com/sky/sharing-scrappy-fiddles-is-hard/)".
I think that maybe my blog should allow me to riff and be a living space rather
than something to be protected & held in perfect condition.
