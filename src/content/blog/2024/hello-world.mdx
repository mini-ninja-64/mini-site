wooo, i have a blog now, in fact ur _probably_ reading this post on it

Like with most things its often fun and informative to explore how we got here,
so to begin I will talk a bit about blog **lore**. This is not my first attempt
at building a blog but it is the first "proper" one I've built and shipped.

<SideNote type="note">
	I did have an old [blogspot/blogger](https://www.blogger.com) as a kid, which
	im not really counting, but its funny to think about
</SideNote>

I decided I wanted to make a blog after reading a number of independednt blogs
and finding them to be consistently inspiring, it got me thinking about projects
I have worked on or build and i felt a bit sad that there was no way to see some
of my oldest code and projects as they are not logged anywhere, this tends to be
at odds with my normal desire to document things and share any and all accrued
knowledge.

Over the past few years I have attempted to make a number of personal websites
but kept getting distracted or busy. This time I decided to try my best to
deliver _something_ I should try and keep things as simple while keeping a solid
base that I can easily extend and find non-limiting.

In my head I had a list of things that would be ideal for my blog, these being:

- Making a blog post should be as easy as making a markdown file
- I do not want blog posts to be limited by markdown as a format
- I want to use JSX for webpage templating as I personally prefer it to raw HTML
  with nunjucks, handlebars etc..
- I want to serve mostly static HTML maybe with the occasional bit of JavaScript
  injected for fun interactive elements like
  <Enticing>
  	<Meowable client:load>üêàthisüêà</Meowable>
  </Enticing>
  , as (imo) it makes for a nice user experience.

# Experiments üë©‚Äçüî¨

Taking my list of desires I wanted to figure out what was feasible, going in I
foresaw at least 2 possible approaches, use a SSG or build my own wierd custom
gluing bits together application, which although appealing would be me yak
shaving possibly leading to me once again not shipping anything and putting my
website back on the project shelf.

Something I had known about and wanted to use for a while was a format called
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for me it seemed perfect for writing blog posts as my
posts would not be limited by Markdown as I can stick components into the post
(TODO: 1 here)

Knowing I would prefer to use an SSG all I needed to do was find one that worked
like I wanted, I had heard good things about [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), so I
tried it out but quickly found it a little bit limiting for my desired use
cases, as I wanted to use JSX for templating I tried to make an 11ty plugin
which worked but got annoyed when I had to keep fighting it to get further, so I
started looking for other options before I went further with rolling my own
plugins (since I carried out this investigation 11ty has gained support for
[MDX](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/mdx/) &
[JSX](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/jsx/)). When looking at different
SSG's I came across a framework called [Astro](https://astro.build/) which from
the sales pitch seemed suspiciously perfect, so I built a little hello-world
project and to my surprise everything I wanted was supported with minimal work
(mostly just adding 1st party dependencies), I could create blog posts in MDX,
create templates in JSX AND generate a fully static site with components that
could be loaded at runtime using the "islands architecture".

<SideNote type="note">
	I am a big fan of the islands architecture as it makes progressive enhancement
	using sprinkles of JS really easy <br /> (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ*:ÔΩ•Ôæü‚úß

# Implementing üë©‚Äçüíª

Building upon my initial PoC work with Astro I built up a project structure I
was happy with, and started building out my webpages, in the end I went with a
mix of Astro & Solid components which worked well for me.

<FileTree name="/">
	<FolderNode name="src">
		<FolderNode name="components">
			<FolderNode name="astro" />
			<FolderNode name="solid" />
		</FolderNode>
		<FolderNode name="content">
			<FolderNode name="blog">
				<FolderNode name="2024">
					<FileNode name="hello-world.mdx" note="u are here :3" />
				</FolderNode>
			</FolderNode>
		</FolderNode>
		<FolderNode name="layouts" />
		<FolderNode name="pages" />
		<FolderNode name="utils" />
	</FolderNode>
</FileTree>

<SideNote type="note">
	This file tree was made using some cool component & tags in the MDX file, see
	[here](TODO)

# Deploying üöÄ

Before this project i had never deployed something to AWS or used terraform, it
was fun and interesting learning about both of them!!

<SideNote type="quest">
	I initially tried using Cloudflare R2 and their CDN to save money but their
	terraform provider is lacking surprisingly basic (imo) features. You can only
	link an R2 bucket to your custom domain through the web console or by using
	some custom terraform to call their API. [Please don't mark issues as
	completed unless they actually
	are.](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/2537)
</SideNote>

Before this blog I had never touched Terraform/OpenTofu/HCL, I initially found
it hard to learn Terraform but after using it for 1 WHOLE project I have come 
to the conclusion that it is fine‚Ñ¢. I feel no strong feelings towards it currently,
I think there are ways it could be improved and also things it does nicely.

TODO: loves and hates list TODO: opentofu is good has cool backend variable
features TODO: I might check out pulumi, but their ai slop is offputting seo
spam

For this project my cloud stack is fairly simple.

aws route53 aws s3 aws cloudfront aws certs

here is how it goes together

wackyness

- index.html routing, i wish cloud front had a magic button to do this, it feels
  dumb af for me to put a custom function for it
- routing www to non www, same thing really

TODO: automation GitHub actions for deploy do i need for terraform

# Next? ü§î

Hopefully more blog posts and working to improve parts of the blog I am unhappy with like 

# Conclusion ü•≥

Anyway that's how we got here, i would love to hear ur thoughts on my setup and
ways i could improve it or have literally ANY thoughts!!!
